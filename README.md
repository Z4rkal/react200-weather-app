### Project Description
This project uses redux to serve a simple weather app. The app makes requests to [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/)'s api, allowing the user to search for current weather data for any city OpenWeather is tracking.

#### Setup:
You can download this project with `git clone https://github.com/Z4rkal/react200-weather-app`.
Then you need to enter the project folder and download the dependencies with `npm install`.
Then you can use `npm start` to launch the app.

The server listens on port 3000, so you can access the web page it serves at `localhost:3000`.
